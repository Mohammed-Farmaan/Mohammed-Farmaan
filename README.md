# Hey! It's Farmaan here.
## I'm a Frontend Engineer from Hyderabad, India. And here's a little brief about me!

### So, I've been married to this Tech for a while now and I think we get along really well:
- #### JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native && Expo, Node, & Python.

### And here's some of the Tech that I've been dating for a while now and I think we're doing good:
- #### Mongo, Express, Tailwind, Next, PWAs, Web Security, Web Assembly, Accessibility & more.

#### I used to write (planning to write more), but meanwhile, you can read some of my [articles](https://dev.to/zxcodes) that are poorly written. And please don't judge me based on those, they're really old! :P

#### You can also check out some of the projects I built (good ones are currently private). And, I also love writing about things other than Tech while taking some pretty good pictures which you can check out [here](https://instagram.com/zx.shots).

#### I guess that's probably it. And if there's anything, you can reach me out on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zxcodes).

>#### Happy Coding! :octocat::heart:
