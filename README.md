Hey! It's Farmaan here.

I'm a Frontend Engineer who mostly does Web & Cross-platform stuff.

I've been working with this Tech for a while now and I think we get along really well:
- JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Expo, Node, & Python.

And here's some of the Tech that I've been following along:
- Mongo, Express, Tailwind, Next, PWAs, Web Security, Web Assembly, Accessibility & more.

I used to write (planning to write more), but meanwhile, you can read some of my [articles](https://dev.to/zxcodes) that are poorly written. And please don't judge me based on those, they're really old! :P

You can also check out some of the projects I built (good ones are currently private). And, I also love writing about things other than Tech while taking some pretty good pictures which you can check out [here](https://instagram.com/zx.shots).


I guess that's probably it. And if there's anything, you can reach me on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zxcodes).

Happy Coding! :octocat::heart:
